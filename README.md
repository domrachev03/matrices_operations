# matrices_operations
System of classes representing different matrices and some basic algorithms which use them

The list of the implemented classes:
- Point
- Matrix
- SquareMatrix
- IdentityMatrix
- PermutationMatrix
- EliminationMatrix
- ColumnVector

Implemented algorithms:
- Gaussian elimination process with pivoting by maximum (in absolute) element
- Jacobi Method
- Seidel Method
- Least Square Approximation

As the result, the program can:
- Calculate the inverse of the matrix
- Solve a equaition A*x = b (A - matrix, b - vector)
- Solve a equation A*x = b for square matrices more efficient
- Find polynomial of given power which suits the best given points in space
- Plot the graph for Least Squares problem
